            was very passionate about law enforcement. I persuaded
            education in Criminal Justice at Caldwell University. After a few
            years, I found another interest in Web Developing. I started
            by self-learning HTML and CSS. I was looking at FreeCodeCamp.org
            and Codecademy.com. Once I felt that I had a better
            understanding, I enrolled in the Full-Stack Development program
            at the UCR extension. After completing the course, I was
            now a Full-Stack Developer. Please feel free to contact me for
            future developing projects.</p>
