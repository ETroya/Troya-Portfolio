            was very passionate about law enforcement. He persuaded his
            education in Criminal Justice at Caldwell University. After a few
            years, Edwin found another interest in Web Developing. He started
            by self-learning HTML and CSS. He was looking at FreeCodeCamp.org
            and Codecademy.com. Once Edwin felt that he had a better
            understanding, he enrolled in the Full-Stack Development program
            at the UCR extension. After completing the course, Edwin Troya was
            now a Full-Stack Developer. Please feel free to contact Edwin for
            future developing projects.</p></div>
